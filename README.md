BBG has been working tirelessly to empower girl children in the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh through its various programs. Their four programs – Suraksha, Swashakti, Ahlada, and Prerna – have positively impacted the lives of 150,000 girl children till now. And now, BBG has added another feather to its crown by starting the construction of two new Bharosa Centers in Shamshabad and Bhongir.

The Bharosa Centers are part of BBG’s fifth program, “Bharosa – Support Center Women & Children.” The centers will offer integrated assistance through Police, Medical, Legal, and Prosecution Services, along with Psychotherapeutic Counseling, for women and children affected by violence. The centers will also provide relief and rehabilitation services as per the requirements of the women and children.

The centers will have an area of 5,600 square feet and various facilities for the multiple services offered. The centers will have conference rooms, counseling rooms for women and children, and a medical counseling room. They will also consist of a Police Officer room, Legal Support office, Statement Record Room, and other necessary facilities.
BBG is grateful to the Telangana Police Department for providing dedicated land for the centers. The company hopes that the centers will help women and children in the surrounding areas to find a haven to register their grievances and seek support for various issues. Furthermore, the centres will work towards building a balanced society where there is equality between men and women, by resolving conflicts in the family and society in general and creating a safe environment for women and children.

BBG is hyper-focused on empowering girl children and has set a goal of empowering 20,000,000 girls by 2040. This is a commendable goal that reflects the company’s commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of girl children. BBG believes that each empowered girl child can positively transform the destiny of their families, society, country, and the world at large.

BBG’s programs are designed to help girls realize their full potential by providing them with the necessary support and resources. The Suraksha program focuses on the safety and security of girl children, while the Swashakti program provides them with life skills and vocational training. The Ahlada program is designed to improve the physical and mental health of girl children, and the Prerna program helps girls pursue their education and career goals.
BBG’s commitment to empowering girl children is commendable, and its efforts are making a positive impact on the lives of thousands of girls. By providing them with the necessary support and resources, BBG is helping girls achieve their full potential and become active participants in building a balanced and prosperous society.
